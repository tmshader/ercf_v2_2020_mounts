These mounts are made for the ERCF v2 and they are able to mount it to the top of a single 2020 extrusion (bedslinger printers usually have this on the top of the printer).

## BOM

- 6 x M3x8 SHCS
- 4 x M3 heat set inserts (Voron inserts recommended, M3x5x4)
- 2 x M3 T-Spring nuts
- 15g of ABS filament

## Print settings

- ABS filament (about 15g)
- Layer height: 0.2mm
- Wall count: 4
- 5 top and bottom shell layers
- Infill: 40% grid, gyroid, honeycomb, triangle or cubic.
- No supports needed
- STLs are oriented in print direction

## Assembly

1. Insert the heat set inserts from the top or the bottom for extra strength.
2. Align the mounts with the feet and srew the mounts into the T-Spring nuts.
3. Screw the feet of the ERCF into the mounts.
4. Done!

## Neptune 4 Pro

These mounts were originally designed for the Neptune 4 Pro.
`Left_Mount.stl` is made specifically to fit onto the top of the N4P because of the short extrusion, but it fits longer 2020 extrusions as well.
